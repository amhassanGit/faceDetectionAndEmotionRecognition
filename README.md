# faceDetectionAndEmotionRecognition
Real-Time Adaptive Costume Creation based on Emotion Classification and Face Detection

Digital emotion recognition has been an active area of research with wide-ranging applications spanning from health and medicine to marketing. Here, I present a face and facial feature tracking algorithm coupled with emotion recognition that is capable of real-time predictions of whether an individual is in a happy state or not. Based on the expressed emotion, a unique costume is then mapped onto their face under the morphological guidance of the detected face and facial features and displayed in real-time over a video stream.

To run this code you will need to have compatible versions of OpenCV and Python compiled.  The .ipnyb file is opened with Jupyter Notebook.
